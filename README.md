# Objective

**Cow Squad** is an NFT Project aimed at supporting different organisations and ready to make a difference!

#  Structure

The cow squad website has only one page. A responsive menu where you will find the sections of the site, **Home**, **Cow Squad** and **Work with us**. The form response (*work with us*) was coded in *PHP* just to return a custom message, it is hosted on my own server.
